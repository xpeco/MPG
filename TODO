- FIX: The daemon must be restarted after a modification in the Email_OUT
table (adding or removing rows) or else will fail.

- FIX: Retry count not working. TODO: When retry count reaches X do something
(alert, notification, unmount...)

- TODO: Existing table entries in Email_OUT older than X without being sent
(because of an error or because not being mounted) should fire an alert 
and/or notification to the Admin.

- TODO: Periodically clean old entries, either by deleting them or by moving them
to a backup table.

- TODO: Less verbose daemon should not output unmounted entries every time, it can create
a lot of output and make it harder to read significant messages.
