- Fix: The daemon must be restarted after a modification in the Email_OUT
table (adding or removing rows).

- Existing table entries in Email_OUT older than X without being sent
(because of an error or because not being mounted) should fire an alert 
and/or notification to the Admin. 

- Periodically clean old entries, either by deleting them or by moving them
to a backup table.

- Fix: Retry count not working. When retry count reaches X do something
(alert, unmount...)

- Less verbose daemon should not output unmounted entries every time.
