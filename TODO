- FIX: Change database name to MPG.

- FIX: Rename files CWMAIL to MPGMAIL.

- FIX: Move Fake From field to EMAIL_OUT.

- FIX: The daemon must be restarted after a modification in the Email_OUT
table (adding or removing rows) or else will fail.

- TODO: Multiple attachments per e-mail.

- TODO: When retry count reaches X, do something
(alert, notification, unmount...)

- TODO: Existing table entries in Email_OUT older than X hours/days/whatever 
without being sent (because of an error or because not being mounted) should
fire an alert and/or notification to the Admin.

- TODO: Periodically clean old entries, either by deleting them or by moving
them to a backup table.

- TODO: Less verbose daemon should not output unmounted entries every time, it
can create a lot of output and make it harder to read significant messages.
