MPG - Multiple Protocol Gateway


DESCRIPTION

    MPG is a system that provides a simple and unified way to use different communication protocols,
    such as e-mail, ftp, twitter, SMS, etc.
    It's intended to be modular, so adding new protocols should be fairly easy.
    
USAGE

    Database and tables
    - Database "Comway" must have the proper structure. See MPGDatabaseStructure.sql.
    - Table Config. Contains the configuration for the smtp accounts to be used.
    - Table Email_OUT. Contains the details of the e-mails.
    - Table Email_ATTACHMENTS. Contains the details of the attachments (if any).
    - Table TwitterConfig. Configuration table for the twitter account.
    - Table TwitterAction. Determines what to do when recieving tweets matching a pattern.
    - Table TwitterMessages. Stores recieved messages recieved via twitter.
    
    Daemons
    - MPGDaemon.pl
    This daemon scans periodically the table Email_OUT in search of rows with field Sent equal to 'N'.
    - twitter.pl
    This daemon checks if there are new twitter messages.
    
    Scripts
    - writemail.pl
    Is a script that makes easy to create new e-mails. Run writemail.pl with no arguments to
    see the usage help.
    Note: New e-mails can also be created simply by adding a new record in the Email_OUT table.
    
FEATURES
    
    - Clustered: Different clients use the same daemon simultaneously without interefering with each other.
    - Currently only supports e-mail and twitter (experimental).

TODO
    Modules for other protocols (ftp, SMS, facebook)
