MPG - Multiple Protocol Gateway

DESCRIPTION

    MPG is a system that provides a simple and unified way to use different communication protocols,
    such as e-mail, ftp, twitter, SMS, etc.
    It's intended to be modular, so adding new protocols should be fairly easy.
    
USAGE

    Database and tables
    - Database "MPG" must have the proper structure. See MPG.sql.
    - Table Config. Contains the configuration for the smtp accounts to be used.
    - Table Email_OUT. Contains the details of the e-mails.
    - Table Email_ATTACHMENTS. Contains the details of the attachments (if any).
    
    Daemon (1.pl)
    The daemon scans periodically the table Email_OUT in search of rows with field Sent equal to 'N' and
    tries to send them in groups of 10, waiting for a few seconds between each try so that the server doesn't
    get overflowed.
    
    Script (writemail.pl)
    writemail.pl is a script that makes easy to create new e-mails. Run writemail.pl with no arguments to
    see the usage help.
    
    New messages can be created simply by adding a new record in the Email_OUT table.
    
FEATURES
    
    - Clustered: Different clients use the same daemon simultaneously without interefering with each other.
    - Currently only supports e-mail.

TODO

    Modules for other protocols (ftp, twitter, SMS)
